# google-photos-merge-metadata

⚠️WARNING⚠️ - I don't plan to invest any more time into this utility. 

----

Using Google Takeout to get all your Google Photos will give you back your photos, but without metadata information (Date/Time and GPS location). This tool should help you merge back all metadata that are exported in a `json` files together with your photos. 

## Requirements

- node v8+
- [exiftool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
